# Maybe-something-about-me
Just a few 
- i really love drawing the characters that i like, it brings comfort and it is also a stress reliever for me.
   + I do like roleplaying with the characters i like, even ships roleplay. my taste on ships might be hated by some people though
  - Playing games bring joy except for the players who ruined it 💔
